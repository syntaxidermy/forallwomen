  <p><h1>We are Sisters Uncut.</h1></center>

    <h2>
    We aim to create and protect respectful,
    understanding and kind spaces where
    people feel able to express themselves,
    discuss their experiences, organise, and
    ask questions without fear of reprisal or humiliation. <br><br>
    
    Those spaces must be inclusive and
    supportive spaces, for all women (trans,
    intersex and cis) and all nonbinary,
    agender and gender-variant people.<br><br>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        There is a lot of misinformation about trans people
        being spread by groups like forwomen.scot.
<b>       Here’s why their scaremongering is misguided.
</b> 
</h3>
<ul>

    <li>It is often vital to maintain safe spaces to escape gendered
    oppression, and Sisters Uncut is itself a space where men are
    not welcome. Trans inclusion has been law in Scotland since
    the 2010 Equality act, so spaces like crisis centres, women’s
    shelters, bathrooms, changing rooms etc have been open
    to all women (cis, trans, intersex and nonbinary) for almost
    a decade. <b>Including trans women has done nothing to
    diminish their worth as safe spaces.<br><br></b>
</li><li>
    Confrontation has always been a critical part of the
    struggle against gender-based oppression. <b>From the
    suffragettes to today’s trans rights battle, the presence of
    conflict and anger from those whose rights are limited has
    always been used to unfairly discredit their struggle.<br><br></b>
  </li><li>
    Almost half of all trans people attempt suicide. But studies
    show that trans kids who are supported by their parents and
    allowed to transition socially (live as their identified gender)
    are no more prone to depression than any other children in
    their peer group. <b>The difference between supporting a child
    through transition and forcing them back into the closet is
    literally life and death.<br><br></b>
  </li><li>
    Trans people have existed for thousands of years before
    modern surgical and hormonal treatments. <b>Everyone has a
    right to bodily autonomy, and nobody’s identity is contingent
    on whether or not they recieve major medical treatment.</b><br><br>
  </li><li>
    Nobody should ever be forced or pressured into sex or
    relationships with anybody. But people deserve to define
    their own sexuality - nobody can decide for them. <b>Nobody
    should have their sexual identity denied just because they
    or their partner are transgender.<br><br></b>
  </li>
  
  </ul>
